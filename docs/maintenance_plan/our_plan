None of our members are interested in continuing to work on the project. However, the project is pretty much what was asked
for by Logan. We have been able to set up the payments and invoices along with letting him have the authority to accept/decline
and create events himself. We have tested the program a lot, however we know that maybe bugs can arise. We believe the only way
to combat it is to contact people in this group that are not going to graduate and/or find a programmer to help. Giving 
resources for the bugs would be hard for someone who is a non-programmer, therefore he would have to find a programmer to help
him. There is a possoible problem with ddos since our server is low-cost therefore someone could try to intentionally crash the
server by sending high amounts of artificial traffic but this case is doubtful.
