1) if you offered to meet with your user to give them a demo/presentation in addition to the April 22 presentations in class? 
How did they respond?

We offered him to come to RAPS and the April 22nd presentation however he could not attend.

2) if you did actually meet with your user to ive them a demo/presentation in addition to the April 22 presentations in class?  

We made a final demo that we are sending him to look at it. He has seen a decent amount of the project already because we have
met with him and showed him different aspects to ask him what to improve.

3) Have they given you any feedback directly?
Yes, as said previously we have met with him a few times to finalize what he wants for the project and have made those changes. 
Changes mainly in what he can do and all the payment stuff. He is happy with what we have accomplished.
