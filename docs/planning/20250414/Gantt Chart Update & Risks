All that was changed was due dates. We were expecting more to have the backend working and demoed by RAPS. We came to the realization that was not attainable at that time. Therefore I have the backend and most of the due dates we had for April 11 moved to April 22nd for the presentation and demo that day. We will spend this week focusing on getting the backend sitauted and getting the invoice/payments together. 

Risks: We are behind in where we should be at this point. We need to pick up the pace on getting the backend going as we need it together in about a week. Backend has proven to be difficilt and there has been some frustrations between group members. We are going to meet twice this week and maybe more to get the backend done and hopefully by next week can polish things up.
