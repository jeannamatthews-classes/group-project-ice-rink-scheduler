Changes are in yellow. These changes are more that we have divided up the work differently than before. We have all started to work on specific things. Backend wise that has primarily become Satya, Emma and Claudia and Frontend wise has been Natalie and Bwahana. Satya and Claudia are focusing on the backend/database, Emma is focusing on the user authentication, Natalie is focusing on the sign up page and connecting the pages, Bwahana is focusing on the reset password page. Our timeline has not really changed it more of what the specifics on what we are working on. I would say we are slighly slipping but we will fully know that by next week.


Risks: The database and backend part hasnt gotten a lot done, starting to realize we need to think about a lot of specifics. We have needed to email/meet with our user a few times to fully figure out.
