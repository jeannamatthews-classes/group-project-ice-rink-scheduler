Changes are in yellow. These changes are more that we have divided up the work differently than before. We have all started to work on specific things. Backend wise that has primarily become Satya, Emma and Claudia and Frontend wise has been Natalie and Bwahana.

Our timeline has not really changed it more of what the sepcifics on what we are working on
