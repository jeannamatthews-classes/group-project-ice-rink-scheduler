This update is that we are starting the project later than anticipated. Instead of starting March 05, we started March 12th,
and Satya did the main view Natalie did the sign up page, Claudia did the Admin view, Emma is still working on Logged in view and Bhawana is still working on reset password view. This is also pushing off starting the authentication of the backend stuff. Right now this doesn't affect the dates for everything. Yellow Highlighted is the changes.
