Yellow is changes. Basically added things for the final deliverable. Satya was able to get the payments mainly working
we still need logan to meet with us to get his specific stripe account. Satya is also working on getting the confirmation
email to work with the gmail API. Everyone else is mainly focusing on the final deliverable stuff. Natalie is working on
the user manuel and adding the necessary new directories onto github. Everyone is updating their design doc from the 
beginning of the project. Adding meetings when needed. Will probably have a meeting with logan and then a final meeting with 
the group about the final deliverable.

Risks: Overall we are in a great position. With less than a week left we have hit the MVP we wanted from the beginning. The only 
risk is fully getting the payment system working the way Logan wanted it. Additionally, we need Logan's Stripe information and 
he has been on vacation so its been diffcult to reach out to him. Hopefully we can squeeze in a meeting with him this week.
In conclusion, our project is right on track and will be finished by the final deliverable, only slight risk in getting 
everything together for the payments.
