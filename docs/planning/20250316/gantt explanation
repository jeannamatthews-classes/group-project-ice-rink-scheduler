This update is that we are starting the project later than anticipated. Instead of starting March 05, we started March 12th,
and Satya did the main view and the rest of us are dividing the logged in view and admin view. This is also pushing off starting
the authentication of the backend stuff. Right now this doesn't affect the dates for everything.
